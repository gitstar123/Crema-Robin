# Crema-Robin

Crema is a financial service app that eliminates the need for waiting in queues at a counter in a cafeteria. You can use the app to view the menu and pay for your food without going to the physical counter to pay and receive the paper receipt. The order id is generated by the app and details of the order are stored in the database which is used by the admin(kitchen operator) to view and serve the food items.
